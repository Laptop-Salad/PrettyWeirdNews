            <p>Photo of Larry from unnamed source - date between 2020-2022.</p>

                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>Sources state that Larry was first sighted around the 
                    years 2020 - 2022 in an English classroom in a school that cannot 
                    be named for privacy reasons.  Larry was placed at the front of the 
                    classroom held up by a piece of tape.</p>    
                <br>
                <p>We interviewed an ex-student of the unnamed school and they stated that a class was 
                    reading a book called “Holes”. Based on our research we suspect the book was “Holes”
                        by Louis Sachar. In the book onions are mentioned repeatedly in relation to a character 
                        called “Sam”.</p>        
            </div>

        <div class="imgt">
            <img src="../assets/01 - Larry/onion.png" alt="">
            <p>The teacher of said class then printed out a picture of an onion and the class decided 
                on the name “Larry”. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Larry’s Personality</h2>

        <div>
            <p>Larry is described as so incredibly lazy and one person we spoke to called him “the most 
                useless class assistant”. However the person also stated that “we still love him for who
                 he is” and “because he’s Larry”. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Another person we spoke to noted that “I once knew of a Larry the onion” which clearly 
                shows the impact that Larry the Onion had left despite it being several years since his 
                last sighting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="imgt">
            <p>During the time Larry was sighted the teacher who first saw him stated that Larry was the 
                laziest substitute teacher that had to have people aid him in breathing despite the fact 
                that he is more than capable of it.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Final Notes</h2>

        <div>
            <p>It is clear that Larry is well beloved and cherished onion despite his negative personality
                traits. He will forever be remembered in our hearts and the hearts of those who knew him.</p>
